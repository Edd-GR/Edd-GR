# Getting started
My name is Edd, I'm currently 21 years old and I'm a novice at programming.

My current interests consist of:
* Listening to music
* Playing videogames
* Lecture and recreative reading

Here I will try to start a registry of my progress on the path of learning how to code.

First and foremost I would like to build a list of my current objectives to learn:

Subject | Current Progress
--------|-----------------
HTML | Zero
Javascript | Zero
CSS | Zero
Python | Zero
C++ | Zero

*I want to get a hold of these elements as quick as possible, so I commit myself to update the before mentioned list regularly*
